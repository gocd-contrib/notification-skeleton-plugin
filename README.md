# Notification plugin skeleton

This is merely a skeleton plugin that plugin developers can fork to get quickly
started with writing notification plugins for GoCD.

## Getting started

* Edit the file `build.gradle`
* Edit the `GetPluginConfigurationExecutor.java` class to add any configuration fields that should be shown in the view.
* Edit the `plugin-settings.template.html` file which contains the view for the plugin settings page of your plugin.
* Edit the `PluginSettings.java` file which contains the model for your settings.
* Implement the `StageStatusRequestExecutor.java` class to get a basic notification plugin working.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## About the license and releasing your plugin under a different license

The skeleton code in this repository is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. The license itself specifies the terms

permissive open source license that has minimal requirements for downstream licensors/licensees to comply with.

This does not prevent your plugin from being licensed under a different license as long as you comply with the relevant
